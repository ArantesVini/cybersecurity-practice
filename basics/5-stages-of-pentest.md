# 5 Stages of Penetration Testing

## 0. First of All (Dislclaimer)

You **always** need to get permission to perform a pentest

## 1. Information Gathering / **Reconnaissance**

Get information about your target to plan your attack.

## 2. Scanning

Search for weakness in your target, like gatways, open door, OS of the target or anything that can be exploited.

## 3. Gaining Acces / **Exploitation**

This is were we actuallly hack the target, to get access to the target devices and be able to steal data or use these devices. After that you can tell a pentest was successful.

## 4. Maintaining Access

This envolves creating _back doors_ or planting _root kits_, programs that allow us to gain access to that target whenever we want, without the need to exploit it again

## 5. Covering Tracks

Remove all evidence that an a attack ever took place. Remove or hidding files, editing logs, or reverting changes you made in the system.
