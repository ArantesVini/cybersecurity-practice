# Acces control Labs

## About my system

To solve the labs of access control i use a Kali Linux runnig in a VM.

## Lab 1. Unprotected Admin Funcionality

This is the easiest lab on PortSwigger, just acess the file robots.txt usign the page URI, the file show me the page `administrator-panel`, so I acess this page and remove the user indicated by the Lab (Carlos).
